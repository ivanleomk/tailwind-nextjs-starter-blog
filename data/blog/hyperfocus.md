# Quick Notes

## The Tl;DR of this book

1. Focus is best thought of as a muscle. Start small and aim to use small sessions in order to slowly build our attention span

2. While being able to focus is important, being able to take a step back and disengage from the task at hand is equally important for creative breakthroughts. Bailey terms this as scatterfocus.

3. We should regularly audit our information sources to see what we're constantly learning and reading in order to help us get higher quality output

## Personal Takeaways

What was most illuminating to me in this book were two main things

1. That we should deliberately choose the ways we take breaks from work. Things like social media and reading comics are not good ways to take breaks because they consume our attention. As a result, when we use them for breaks, we are unable to come back to our work rested and ready to go

2. Consistency is important when it comes to building an ability to focus. I'd always heard people talking about the pomodoro method and setting a timer for 25 minutes. This was always difficult for me because after just 5 minutes my mind would wander and I would blame myself. This is similarly echoed in Atomic Habits.

3. Invest in happiness. Happy people are more productive, learn faster and create more.

## What am I implementing

1. I'm going to start an audit of my information sources. This is something that's been long overdue and i'm confident that it will reap wonders for me

2. I'm going to start tracking the metrics which Bailey suggested tracking. These are namely

- How much time can I spend holding my focus in a single sitting
- How long does my mind take to start wondering before I catch it

3. Setting up some time each weekend to journal for 15 minutes. Bailey calls it by Capture Mode but if you've ever done any form of acting, it's basically a stream of consciousness exercise. I think it'll be interesting to try it for a few weeks and see what I'll get out of it.

## Who would I recommend it to?

I would probably recommend it to anyone looking for a good self-help book to take them to the next level. This is a book which provided good quality information in the form of theory and actionable insights.

# Detailed Summary of Content and personal notes

1. Learning how to unfocus is as important as how to focus. Without focusing, we'd never be able to do anything great while unfocusing is the only way we can achieve any form of creative insight

2. Be proactive and consider the distractions which you'll be dealing with in advance. Some good ways to do so are to (1) put your devices away and set clear rules before starting work and (2) Scheduling your focus time during periods where you know you won't be distracted.

3. Most of our life is lived in auto-pilot where most decisions are made without much deliberation. We should therefore aim to instead be deliberate about a finite number of things and make sure that we focus our entire attentional space to the single task

4. The more mundane a task, the more easily distracted we become. That's why mindfulness is fantastic for building our attentional space so that we can focus on things

5. Invest in your own happiness. You'll be able to reap wonders in the form of increased productivity, output and creative breakthoughs.

6. It's ok to not be able to focus. What's most important is that you're actively working to (1) Expand your attentional space and (2) deliberately engaging in tasks that do so

7. While it's important to consider the quality of your focus and your ouput, you need to make sure you have a certain quality of input. You don't need to optimize every single aspect of this nor cut out 100% of all useless content but you should be thinking about this every once in a while

8. Breaks need to be enjoyed with activities that do not take up your own attentional space. This is the only way that you'll be able to come back to your original task rested and ready to go

9. Your enviroment matters. Make sure to slowly remove things that might distract you (eg. Messy areas, Mobile phones )

10. Aim to be consistent with building your hyperfocus instead of simply pushing through with willpower. Expanding your attentional space and growing it is the result of a daily commitment to hyperfocus. It's ok to do a little bit a day because it all adds up in the end.
