# Why

I've been thinking about writing up my personal website for the longest time. I wanted a place where I could reflect about what I've been learning about and track my thought evolution over time.

## Inspiration

I recently chanced upon Ali Abdaal's website where he talked about his desire to start journalling everyday. He was inspired by one of his idols, Matthew Dicks, who had been writing every single day since 2003. (You can read it [here](https://aliabdaal.com/my-new-public-journal/))

To quote Abdaal,

> He then dropped the bomb that I'd been completely unaware of - that he's been blogging every day since 2003.
>
> I'll let that sink in. He's been writing a blog post. Every single day. Since 2003.
>
> It helps him think, it helps him figure out what his ideas are, and it's a great way to journal in public. He spends around 30 minutes writing the post each morning. He often starts by writing "I've been thinking about..." or "I recently read..." and lets the ideas flow from there.

Serendipidity then struck and I found this amazing template for an NextJS blog written by timlrx ([check it out](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)).

With these two individual things coming together, I decided to give the blogging journey a try and hopefully see where it goes.

# The Plan

I'm currently already writing a weekly newsletter I call [What's Up](https://ivanleo.substack.com/) where I talk a bit about what current affair topics have caught my attention in the last week or so.

I've found that

- I've really enjoyed the experience of writing something up week after week

- Writing a concise summary forces me to really exmaine what are the largest and most important pieces of information that matter

So i'd like to build on that momentum that's already there and work towards creating more content in the form of newsletters, blog posts and maybe even youtube videos. So without much ado, here's the existing plan

1. A monthly journal of my goals - I think this will help keep me accountable and help me be more consistent in terms of executing on my goals. [Research backs this up too](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-bul0000025.pdf)

2. Starting an additional newsletter - I plan to follow suit what abdaal is doing at the moment and send a weekly newsletter of what I've been reading, what I've been thinking about and what I plan to achieve in the weeks ahead

3. Book Reviews + Anti-Libraries - While I mostly rely on good reads to document my reading, i've found myself to be remarkly inconsistent with it. I plan to start documenting two main things - what i've read and what I plan to read

4. Random articles/listicles when I feel like it

Ultimately this website should serve as documentation first and foremost - of my thoughts and anything else second.
